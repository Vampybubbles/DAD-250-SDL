Liam the Client wanted to make an online system that has both written test preparation materials and gives the client the ability to schedule in person driving lessons. In designing for this system I did a good job defining several of the vital systems that would be needed. I wish I could revise my last few diagrams and add in the notation for the different relationships. I think leaving it out makes the later steps more difficult. Defining them in the planning stage is much easier and allows the later steps to just be created according to the directions laid out in the diagram. 
I considered the client wants when making anything as if he isn’t happy with it because it doesn’t contain something he said he wanted, simply because I forgot or over looked it, then the creation only gets delayed and the relationship may become strained as Liam would feel that we aren’t listening to their wants. 
For designing software I use a lot of planning. Both with diagrams and pseudocode so I have an outline to fill in with the meat of the code. I also would make everything is steps and test before moving on to making another section. Using place holder code that gives back a message that something triggered as intended while coding is an easy(ish) way to accomplish that.
